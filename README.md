# dotfiles
A repository to store my dotfiles. My mentality is to **be minimal with vi everywhere**

## Requirements
Even if everything is technically optional, this dotfiles are designed to work with:
* x11
* dwm / st / dmenu
* dwmblocks-async
* zsh
* neovim
* tmux
* lf
In this repository are included the software I installed without my package manager (pacman) as submodules.
You can also find the full list of packages installed on my system in **.config/patches/package.list**.

## Installation
Download the script named **dotfiles-setup.sh** stored in **.local/bin** and run it.  
`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xenorf/dotfiles/main/.local/bin/dotfiles-setup.sh | sh`
